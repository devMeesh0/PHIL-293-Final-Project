# Final Project: Interdisciplinary Analysis

Welcome to the repository for our final project, which integrates diverse topics across Philosophy, Mathematics, Community Studies, Healthcare, and Legal frameworks. This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that encapsulate data analysis, theoretical exploration, and practical applications in these areas.

## Project Overview

This project is an exploration of key issues and concepts through interdisciplinary lenses:

1. **Philosophy (`PHIL_293_Final_Project.ipynb`)**
   - Investigates philosophical theories and their real-world implications.
   - Includes data-driven approaches to ethical dilemmas.

2. **Community Studies (`community.ipynb`)**
   - Examines community dynamics and the influence of social structures.
   - Uses datasets to model and visualize community interactions.

3. **Mathematics (`math.ipynb`)**
   - Focuses on mathematical models and problem-solving.
   - Applies mathematical frameworks to real-world scenarios.

4. **Healthcare (`healthcare.ipynb`)**
   - Analyzes healthcare systems and policies.
   - Utilizes statistical techniques to assess outcomes.

5. **Legal Studies (`legal.ipynb`)**
   - Discusses legal principles and their applications.
   - Includes case studies and simulations of legal challenges.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Final-Project.git
   cd Final-Project
   ```
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can set up the environment using:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
3. Open the notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Navigate to the respective `.ipynb` files in the Jupyter interface to explore or run the code.

## Dependencies

To run the notebooks seamlessly, ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (for any machine learning components)
- statsmodels (for advanced statistical analysis)

Install these packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
```

## Project Highlights

- **Philosophy**: Ethical analysis backed by real-world data.
- **Community**: Visualizations of social dynamics.
- **Mathematics**: Problem-solving with real-world applications.
- **Healthcare**: Policy evaluation through statistical methods.
- **Legal Studies**: Case-based simulations and insights.
